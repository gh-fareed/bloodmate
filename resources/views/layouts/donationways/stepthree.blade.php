If you experience any discomfort, dizziness, or other unusual sensations, inform our team immediately.</p>

            <p>You'll have the option to sit or lie down for as long as necessary and receive appropriate nourishment and hydration.<br> Once you feel better, you can resume your activities, but it's important to refrain from driving for at least 12 hours as a precaution. </p>
            <p>Remember: such reactions are uncommon, occurring in less than 3% of donors.<br> Your safety and well-being are our top priorities. </p>
